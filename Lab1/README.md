## Laboratory work #1

# Subject:
	Simple client/server application

# Objective:
	Familiarize yourself with the BSD sockets API by writing a simple server and a client.

# Requirements:
	- The program must rely on the BSD sockets API, not some other library which is an abstraction on top of BSD sockets.
	- TCP must be used at the transport layer.
	- IP must be used at the network layer.

**Implemented command:**
	- `Time` 		- returns current server time to client
	- `Marco` 	- returns `Polo` to client
	- `Knock, Knock` - returns `Who's there?`
	- `random string` - returns `Can you elaborate on that?`
	- `random string?` - returns `42`
	- `Hastalavista` - closes server
